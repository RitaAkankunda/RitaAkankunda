## 👋 Hi, I’m Akankunda Rita  

🎓 Computer Science Student  
💻 Web & Software Development  
🌍 Uganda  

I’m a Computer Science student passionate about building **useful, real-world applications** and continuously improving my software development and problem-solving skills.

I started my CS journey with **zero coding experience**, and through consistent learning and hands-on projects, I’ve grown into building web and software solutions using both frontend and backend technologies. I enjoy learning how systems work, collaborating with others, and turning ideas into functional products.

## 🎯 What I’m Currently Focused On
- Web application development (frontend & backend)  
- Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code  
- Learning through real projects, internships, and collaboration  
- Strengthening core software development fundamentals
