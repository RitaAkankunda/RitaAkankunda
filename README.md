## 👋 Hi, I’m Akankunda Rita  

🎓 Computer Science Student  
💻 Web & Software Development  
🌍 Uganda  

I’m a Computer Science student passionate about building **useful, real-world applications** and continuously improving my problem-solving and software development skills.

I started my CS journey with **zero coding experience**, and through consistent learning and hands-on projects, I now build web and software solutions using modern tools and frameworks. I enjoy learning how things work, breaking problems down, and turning ideas into working systems.

## 🎯 What I’m Currently Focused On
- Web application development  
- Writing clean, maintainable, and readable code  
- Learning through real projects and collaboration
